# TSGAssist

**[TSGAssist](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol17/p4309-huang.pdf)** is an interactive assistant that integrates the strengths of TSGBench and utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for TSG recommendations and benchmarking &#x1F916;&#x1F4CA;

This work is currently under patent application. For more details, please visit the latest repository on [Time Series Generation](https://github.com/YihaoAng/TSGBench).

**We are actively exploring industrial collaborations in time series analytics. Please feel free to reach out (yihao_ang AT comp.nus.edu.sg) if interested** &#x1F91D;&#x2728;

## Overview of TSGAssist

TSGAssist is an interactive assistant harnessing LLMs and RAG for time series generation recommendations and benchmarking.
- It offers multi-round personalized recommendations through a conversational interface that bridges the cognitive gap,
- It enables the direct application and instant evaluation of users' data, providing practical insights into the effectiveness of various methods.
